# Data Structures Tutorial

## I. Welcome

* Introduction
    In this project, I will teach you how to use various technologies to solve problems. These will not be 
    a conclusive guide on how to use these technologies as they will be based on the knowledge I have. Nonetheless, they will be useful in furthering your understanding.  

    *Topics to be covered (hyperlinks)
    1. Stacks
    2. Set
    3. Tree

## II. Stack 

* Introduction
*  I will introduce stacks here, then explain what a stack is.

* Efficiency of common operations
    (I will detail a couple of problems and then explain what is happening in the stacks, I will cover Push, pop, Size, Count (Will possible add more later))
    
    Common operation 1
        Details will go here

    Common operation 2
        Details will go here
    
    Common operation 3
        Details go here

* Example Problem
    I will then detail the problem here.

    *Statement of the problem
        I will state the problem here
    
    *Problem Analaysis
        I will then break down the problem, maybe include pictures here to.

    *Problem solution
        I will then solve the problem here. adding in any necessary details
* Problem to Solve
    I will then follow the same format as above and give the reader a problem to solve.

## III. Set
* Introduction
    I will follow the same format as above. Introduce Sets and explain how to use them

* Efficiency of common operations
    (I will include both the efficiency and the operations in this section eg, intersection)

    Common operation 1
        Details will go here

    Common operation 2
        Details will go here
    
    Common operation 3
        Details go here

* Example Problem
    The example problem will follow the same formating as the Problem in in the stack.

     I will then detail the problem here.

    *Statement of the problem
        I will state the problem here
    
    *Problem Analaysis
        I will then break down the problem, maybe include pictures here to.

    *Problem solution
        I will then solve the problem here. adding in any necessary details
* Problem to Solve
    I will then follow the same format as above and give the reader a problem to solve.

## IV. Tree
* Introduction
    This will also pretty much follow the same format as the other problems.
* ...
* Efficiency of common operations

    I will talk about the types of types of operations you have can will trees. I plan on also covering recursion. I will only cover a B tree since I believe that is all we covered in class. (I will then cover how to transve a tree, fowards, backwards and how to do it recursively)

    Common operation 1
        Details will go here

    Common operation 2
        Details will go here
    
    Common operation 3
        Details go here
* Example Problem

    Example Problem
    The example problem will follow the same formating as the Problem in in the stack.

     I will then detail the problem here.

    *Statement of the problem
        I will state the problem here
    
    *Problem Analaysis
        I will then break down the problem, maybe include pictures here to.

    *Problem solution
        I will then solve the problem here. adding in any necessary details

* Problem to Solve
    I will then follow the same format as above and give the reader a problem to solve.
