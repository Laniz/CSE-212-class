# Data Structures Tutorial
## I. Welcome
* Introduction
    In this project, I will teach you how to use various technologies to solve problems. These will not be 
    a conclusive guide on how to use these technologies as they will be based on the knowledge I have. Nonetheless, they will be useful in furthering your understanding. 

    *Topics to be covered (hyperlinks)*
    1. Stacks
    2. Set
    3. Tree

## II. Stack 
* Introduction
    I will introduce stacks here, then explain what a stack is.

* Common Operations
    * Push - Adds an element to the top of the stack (O(1))
    * Pop - Removes the top element from the stack (O(1))
    * Peek/Top - Retrieves the top element without removing it (O(1))
    * isEmpty - Checks if the stack is empty (O(1))
    * Size - Returns the number of elements in the stack (O(1))

* Efficiency of common operations
    (I will detail a couple of problems and then explain what is happening in the stacks)
    
    Common operation 1
        Details will go here

    Common operation 2
        Details will go here
    
    Common operation 3
        Details go here
* Example Problem
    I will then detail the problem here.

    *Statement of the problem*
        I will state the problem here
    
    *Problem Analysis*
        I will then break down the problem, maybe include pictures here too.

    *Problem solution*
        I will then solve the problem here, adding in any necessary details

## III. Set
* Introduction
    I will introduce sets here and explain their properties and use cases.

* Basic Operations
    * Union
    * Intersection
    * Difference
    * Subset Checking

* Efficiency of common operations
    * Insertion: O(1) on average
    * Deletion: O(1) on average
    * Search: O(1) on average

* Example Problem
    *Statement of the problem*
        I will state the problem related to sets here.
    
    *Problem Analysis*
        I will then break down the problem, possibly including diagrams or explanations.
    
    *Problem Solution*
        I will then solve the problem step by step.

## IV. Tree
* Introduction
    I will introduce trees here and explain their structure, components, and importance.

* Types of Trees
    * Binary Trees
    * Binary Search Trees
    * AVL Trees
    * B-Trees

* Tree Traversal Methods
    * In-order Traversal
    * Pre-order Traversal
    * Post-order Traversal
    * Level-order Traversal

* Efficiency of common operations
    * Insertion: O(log n) in balanced trees
    * Deletion: O(log n) in balanced trees
    * Search: O(log n) in balanced trees

* Example Problem
    *Statement of the problem*
        I will state the problem related to trees here.
    
    *Problem Analysis*
        I will then break down the problem, using examples or diagrams.
    
    *Problem Solution*
        I will then solve the problem with detailed steps and explanations.
