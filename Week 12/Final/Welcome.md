# Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to the Data Structures Tutorial. Every programmer should understand these fundamental data structures:

- [Stack](stacks.md)
- [Sets](sets.md)
- [Tree](Tree.md)

You'll learn through descriptions and examples within each module. Each module concludes with a problem to reinforce your understanding. Try solving it independently before reviewing the solution.
